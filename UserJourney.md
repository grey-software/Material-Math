# User Journey

I enter the app, and I’m presented with a beautiful splash screen. On the home page, I can select the concepts I want to practice, the time I’d like to practice for, and the difficulty I want to set for each concept. 

On my Homepage I see a button on the right side of each concept that takes me to the stats for that concept. My recent high-scores and my recent progress.

I can navigate to the profile, stats, and leaderboards pages from the home page. 

## Free Mode
I can select the math concepts I want to practice, the difficulty, and the number of questions, or time that I want to spend practicing.

### Practice Session
I start the practice session, and see one question at a time. I can see my highest streak count, and either a timer or a progress bar. I can skip a question if it’s too hard for me. 

### Post Practice Session

After the session, I get a summary of the concepts I practiced, xp I gained, etc.

I get the ability to generate a report, and share my practice session details. I go back to the home page with the previous session’s config already selected. 


## Arcade Mode
I can see a set number of configurations for arcade mode, like ‘Basic Arithmetic’, ‘Trigonometry’, or ‘Fundamental Algebra’, and I can see my high scores for each mode. I can also see a Leaderboard that shows the high scores of other users for each config.

### Practice Session
I start the practice session, and see one question at a time. I can see my highest streak count, a timer and a progress bar displaying my previous high score and the bar increases as you reach closer. I see a pass button that passes the question, which comes again. 

### Post-Practice Session
After the game ends, I see a screen that compares my current score with the high score, and presents an animation accordingly. 

If I’m online, I see my score’s rank in the leaderboards, and I can restart with one click. 

There’s a button to send my config to my friend and challenge them to beat my high score.
